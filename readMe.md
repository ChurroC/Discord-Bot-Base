This is a simple way to start to build a discord bot. All you have to do is just
add commands and Slash Commands to the appropriate folders . Also remeber to add
BOT_TOKEN, GUILD_ID, and CLIENT_ID. Run npm deploy to deploy to deploy the slash
commands to the server.

Still have to add embeds. Have to add comments.

Also have database or cache mode

Like on vs once add a dev so only use that during deelopment guild ocmmands

Add a musivoic option

Add a button that creates a new buttion layer and you can dd and rmeoe button
rows first one wiill have a add new row the rest will have remove a row and add
a row

make some normal commands have array of names to have mutlple names viunded to
noe function.

Use a collector to see who says hi first

add a cli comamdn to convert to sharding easy.

Maybe move name from query_version so you have to do this:
query_versionAutoComplete to be able to use camelcase queryVersionAutoComplete

Add a logger

Maybe get model based of snowflake
