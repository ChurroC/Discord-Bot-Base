This is a simple way to start to build a discord bot. All you have to do is just add commands and Slash Commands to the
appropriate folders . Also remeber to add BOT_TOKEN, GUILD_ID, and CLIENT_ID. Run npm deploy to deploy to deploy the
slash commands to the server.

Talk about how console.error will end logging the error and putting into log If you do want an error to stop exectution
you can throw but error will allow bot to keep running but still in log.
