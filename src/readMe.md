This is a simple way to start to build a discord bot. All you have to do is just
add commands and Slash Commands to the appropriate folders . Also remeber to add
BOT_TOKEN, GUILD_ID, and CLIENT_ID. Run npm deploy to deploy to deploy the slash
commands to the server.

Also have database or cache mode

Add a musivoic option with a cli that adds it for you

add a cli comamdn to convert to sharding easy.

Add a logger

Maybe get model based of snowflake Spent like 3 hours doing stuff to mdify
classes and when I finally finsihe it I realized it's to wierd to import
something from a file and not discord and add interaciotn as param so yeah just
force them to use interaction.commandName as customID or until I get a better
idea

Still need to add voice

Add subcommand group support in subcomand.js

Also make music a subcommand automatically.

Maybe have an object for all the function params so I cold do this
async execute({ interaction, user })
instead of 
async execute(interaction, client, db, user)

subcommandGroup needed
if bot couldnt join vc reply with error
maybe fix deepreaddir
tic tac toe image cnavas eddito using nap thing
have an all command command taht has button with pagination and a sleect menu for catgeories which you could add to command as another objext

for voice use musicxmatch and add mpagination in yshowign music
have a command to amke embed with lyrics take up whole screen maybe change absed of phoen or computer
maybe have splti screen transalation
make lyrics enable button disabled when no lyrics for current song or have it enabled and display no lyrics
aslo have a select menu for all, lyrics, next up, current song
have a .notCommand.js to show not command

also if they cant join the vc because of permission send an error
